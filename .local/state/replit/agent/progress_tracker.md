[x] 1. Install the required packages
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working
[x] 3. Verify the project is working using the feedback tool
[x] 4. Inform user the import is completed and they can start building, mark the import as completed using the complete_project_import tool
[x] 5. Remove video section from all celebrity categories
[x] 6. Fix cross-env issue by reinstalling dependencies
[x] 7. Configure workflow with proper webview output type and port 5000
[x] 8. Verify application is running successfully
[x] 9. Fixed back button - moved below navigation bar (top-20/top-24), made it larger (h-12 w-12) and icon-only
[x] 10. FIXED scroll-to-top button positioning issue - wrapped Button in fixed-position div wrapper so it properly floats on the screen and follows user's scroll (was being overridden by Button's relative positioning)
[x] 11. Fixed celebrity profile image - reduced height to 500px, added object-top to focus on face/upper body and prevent stretching
[x] 12. Fixed back button navigation - now uses window.history.back() to return to previous page (category) instead of always going to home page
[x] 13. Changed mobile view to 2 columns (grid-cols-2) for all celebrity cards on Home, CategoryPage, and FeaturedSection
[x] 14. Improved celebrity profile image - reduced height to 450px, centered object position, lighter gradient overlay for cleaner look
[x] 15. Fixed celebrity cards - reduced dark overlay (from black/90 to black/70), made glassmorphic card smaller (p-4 to p-3), more image visible
[x] 16. Fixed profile page overlap - reduced negative margin from -mt-32 to -mt-16 so content card doesn't cover hero image as much
[x] 17. Reinstalled npm dependencies to fix cross-env issue
[x] 18. Configured workflow with webview output type and port 5000
[x] 19. Verified application is running successfully (Email service warning is expected - not critical)
[x] 20. Fixed celebrity cards text overlay - strengthened gradient, improved card background with solid dark overlay (bg-black/60), better text contrast and readability
[x] 21. Made celebrity cards more compact - reduced padding, font sizes, and spacing so more of the celebrity image is visible
[x] 22. Implemented likes tracking system - added likes field to schema, storage methods, API routes, and frontend integration
[x] 23. Updated Featured section to show most liked celebrities (sorted by likes descending)
[x] 24. Updated Trending section to show most viewed celebrities (sorted by views descending)
[x] 25. Fixed MongoStorage decrementCelebrityLikes to prevent negative values using conditional updates
[x] 26. FIXED celebrity card image positioning - added object-top to ensure faces are always visible at the top, made info card even smaller (reduced all padding, fonts, and spacing), darker background for better contrast
[x] 27. Migration complete - all dependencies installed, workflow configured with webview output and port 5000, application running successfully with MongoDB connected (155 celebrities loaded)
[x] 28. FIXED all celebrity cards to have consistent size - set fixed height of 60px for info cards, removed flex-wrap, used truncate for text overflow, smaller fonts and padding, ensures all cards look identical and don't cover faces
[x] 29. FIXED scroll to top on page navigation - added useEffect with window.scrollTo in CategoryPage and CelebrityProfile so users are taken to top of page instead of footer when clicking categories or celebrities
